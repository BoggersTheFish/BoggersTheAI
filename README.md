**BoggersTheAI** is a local-first **TS-OS (Thinking System Operating System)** — a living graph and wave-propagation reasoning engine that treats truth as the most stable configuration its constraints allow. Instead of scaling a single monolithic language model, BoggersTheAI maintains a persistent knowledge graph of nodes (concepts) and edges (relations), each carrying activation, stability, and base-strength values that evolve continuously through a wave cycle of propagation, relaxation, pruning, tension detection, emergence, and contradiction resolution. The result is an AI runtime that learns, adapts, and reasons locally — with optional LLM synthesis, self-improvement via QLoRA fine-tuning, multimodal input/output, and a full observability stack.

## Philosophy — What Is TS-OS?

TS-OS (Thinking System Operating System) is founded on a single axiom:

> **Everything that exists is a stable cluster of constraints.**

A "thought" is not a token sequence — it is a configuration of interconnected nodes whose activations have settled into a locally optimal arrangement. Change is wave propagation through the graph. Complexity emerges from local interactions. Truth is whatever configuration the constraints converge on.

The core loop — running continuously in a background thread — is:

```
while true:
    Propagate()   — wave spreads activation from the strongest node
    Relax()       — activations decay toward their base strength
    if tension too high:
        Break()   — collapse the weakest node / pattern
    Evolve()      — spawn higher-stability structures (emergence)
```

This loop is not a metaphor. It literally runs on a thread inside the runtime, mutating graph state every `wave.interval_seconds`. The graph is alive.

### Core Primitives

| Primitive | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Node** | A concept: carries `content` (text), `topics` (set), `activation` (0–1 heat), `stability` (0–1 groundedness), `base_strength` (resting state), `embedding` (vector), `collapsed` (boolean) |
| **Edge** | A relation between two nodes: carries `weight` (0–1 strength) and `relation` (label) |
| **Wave** | One full cycle: elect → propagate → relax → normalize → prune → merge → split → contradiction check → tension check → emergence |
| **Tension** | A scalar score indicating how much a node's constraints are violated |
| **Emergence** | The system synthesizing a *new* node from high-tension regions — genuinely novel structure |

---

## How It Differs from Standard AI

| Dimension | Standard LLM | BoggersTheAI / TS-OS |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Knowledge store | Frozen weights | Living, mutable graph with persistence |
| Reasoning | Single forward pass | Iterative wave propagation converging over time |
| Learning | Expensive retraining | Continuous graph evolution + optional QLoRA fine-tune |
| Contradiction handling | Hallucination | Explicit detection and resolution via stability comparison |
| Transparency | Black box | Full reasoning trace, activation scores, tension values |
| Autonomy | Responds only when prompted | Background OS loop explores, consolidates, and generates insights when idle |
| Multimodal | Requires separate models per modality | Unified pipeline: audio/image → transcription/caption → graph → synthesis |
| Cost | Cloud GPU bills | Runs on a laptop with Ollama; GPU optional for fine-tuning only |

BoggersTheAI can and does use an LLM (via Ollama) for synthesis, but the LLM is a *tool* the graph uses — not the other way around. The graph decides what context to provide, scores sufficiency, generates hypotheses, checks consistency, and only then asks the LLM to produce natural language.

---

## Complete Feature List

### Graph Engine
- **WaveCycleRunner** (`core/graph/wave_runner.py`) — owns background wave thread lifecycle and step order; graph holds data, runner executes elect → propagate → relax → … → save
- **UniversalLivingGraph** with thread-safe concurrent access (RLock)
- Dual persistence: **SQLite** (WAL mode, default) or **JSON**
- Topic index for O(1) topic-based lookups
- Adjacency dictionary for fast neighbor traversal
- Node embeddings via **OllamaEmbedder** (`nomic-embed-text`) on creation
- Hybrid propagation: topological (edge weight) + semantic (cosine similarity)
- Activation normalization with configurable damping and cap
- Incremental save every N waves (only dirty nodes persisted)
- Resource guardrails: max nodes, max cycles/hour, tension-based pause
- Strongest-node caching with invalidation on mutation
- Snapshot versioning: save, list, restore, delete full graph states (max 50 with auto-pruning)
- GraphML and JSON-LD export for interoperability
- **Pure graph helpers** (`core/graph/operations.py`): neighborhood BFS (`get_subgraph_around`), bulk insert (`batch_add_nodes`), connected components, activation-range filtering — usable without loading the full runtime

### Query Pipeline
- Topic extraction (regex tokenizer, stopword removal)
- Graph-aware context retrieval (topic index + activated subgraph, top-k scoring)
- Sufficiency scoring (count + activation + recency weighted)
- Automatic ingestion from adapters when context is insufficient
- Tool routing for calc, search, code execution, and file reading
- LLM synthesis with hypotheses, confidence, and reasoning trace
- Extractive fallback when LLM is unavailable
- Hypothesis consistency checking against existing graph nodes
- High-confidence trace logging for self-improvement
- Consolidation: new query node linked to context nodes
- Vault insight writing when enabled

### Self-Improvement
- Automatic trace logging of high-confidence responses
- TraceProcessor: scans traces, filters by confidence, converts to Alpaca format
- 80/20 train/val split with configurable thresholds
- UnslothFineTuner: 4-bit QLoRA on configurable base models
- Validation gating before hot-swap
- Adapter rollback on degradation
- Safety dry-run mode

### Autonomy
- Background wave thread with configurable interval
- OS loop: exploration, consolidation, and insight generation when idle
- Nightly consolidation (deep prune/merge/emergence at configured UTC hour)
- Multi-turn session memory via session nodes in the graph
- Cognitive temperament presets (contemplative, analytical, reactive, critical, creative, default)
- Mode manager: AUTO/USER coordination with timeout-based lock

### Multimodal
- **Voice in:** faster-whisper transcription with temp file cleanup
- **Voice out:** piper-tts or placeholder fallback
- **Image in:** BLIP2-style captioning or placeholder fallback
- Graceful degradation when dependencies are missing

### Observability
- CLI with status, graph stats, trace inspection, wave control, and history
- Rich TUI with live graph stats and wave events
- FastAPI dashboard with status JSON, Chart.js tension chart, Cytoscape.js graph visualization, metrics, and trace viewer
- Token-based authentication for dashboard endpoints
- Per-module health checks with duration tracking
- Thread-safe metrics: counters, gauges, timers
- EventBus for decoupled module communication

### Extensibility
- Plugin registry with entry-point discovery (adapter and tool plugins)
- AdapterRegistry with TTL caching and rate limiting (cache access is thread-safe)
- ToolRegistry with rule-based routing
- ContextMind: named subgraph views with per-context temperament
- **HTTP resilience** (`adapters/http_client.py`): `fetch_url` / `fetch_json` with exponential backoff — used by Wikipedia, RSS, Hacker News
- **Path sandbox** (`core/path_sandbox.py`): `validate_path` for markdown/vault/file reads under a fixed base directory

### Runtime composition (v0.5.0)
- **`BoggersRuntime`** inherits **`AutonomousLoopMixin`** (`interface/autonomous_loop.py`) and **`SelfImprovementMixin`** (`interface/self_improvement.py`) — OS loop, nightly consolidation, and self-improvement logic live in dedicated modules; `runtime.py` remains the public composition root
- **Dashboard** uses **`get_runtime()`** (lazy singleton) so importing `dashboard.app` does not construct the full runtime at import time

### Additional tools (beyond calc / search / code / file_read)
- **WebSearchTool** — DuckDuckGo instant-answer API (no API key)
- **DateTimeTool** — current UTC time, parse/format helpers
- **UnitConvertTool** — common unit pairs (km/miles, kg/lbs, °C/°F, m/ft)

---

## Prerequisites

### Required

- **Python 3.10 or later** (tested on 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- **`config.yaml`** at the project root (ships with the repo, loaded automatically by `core/config_loader.py`)

### Recommended

- **Ollama** — required for LLM synthesis and embeddings. Install from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/), then pull models:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2          # or whichever model matches inference.ollama.model
ollama pull nomic-embed-text  # for node embeddings (if embeddings.enabled: true)
```

### Optional

- **GPU + VRAM (8 GB+):** for Unsloth QLoRA fine-tuning. CPU-only works for everything else.
- **X/Twitter API access:** set `X_BEARER_TOKEN` environment variable and enable `adapters.enabled.x_api` in config.
- **feedparser:** pulled automatically for RSS ingestion.
- **faster-whisper, piper-tts, transformers:** for multimodal features. The system gracefully degrades if these are absent.

---

## Installation

From the **`BoggersTheAI`** directory (the one containing `pyproject.toml`):

```bash
# Core only — graph, wave engine, query processor, CLI
pip install -e .

# Core + Ollama for LLM synthesis and embeddings
pip install -e ".[llm]"

# Core + Unsloth + PyTorch for QLoRA fine-tuning (requires GPU)
pip install -e ".[gpu]"

# Core + dev tools (pytest, black, ruff, isort, mypy, fastapi, uvicorn)
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Everything
pip install -e ".[all]"
```

| Extra | What It Adds |
|-------|-------------|
| `llm` | `ollama` Python client for LLM synthesis and embedding generation |
| `gpu` | `unsloth`, `torch`, `trl`, `datasets` for QLoRA fine-tuning |
| `dev` | `pytest`, `pytest-cov`, `black`, `ruff`, `isort`, `mypy`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `ollama` |
| `multimodal` | `faster-whisper`, `transformers`, `pillow`, `piper-tts` |
| `adapters` | `feedparser` (RSS and related ingestion) |
| `all` | Broader union (see `pyproject.toml` — includes rich, feedparser, etc.) |
| `security` | `defusedxml` — safer XML parsing for RSS when installed |

**Developer workflow:** a **`Makefile`** at the project root provides `make test`, `make lint`, `make format`, `make run`, `make dashboard`. **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`** hooks ruff, black, and isort (optional local install: `pre-commit install`).

---

## First Run

### 1. Environment Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` if you use API tokens. **Never commit `.env`.**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to add X_BEARER_TOKEN, BOGGERS_DASHBOARD_TOKEN, etc.
```

### 2. Start Ollama

If `inference.ollama.enabled` is `true` (default), ensure Ollama is running:

```bash
ollama serve
```

### 3. Launch the CLI

```bash
boggers
```

You will see the TS-OS banner and a `boggers>` prompt. The background wave thread is already running. Type `help` to see commands, or just ask a question.

### 4. Minimal Python Usage

```python
from BoggersTheAI import BoggersRuntime

rt = BoggersRuntime()
print(rt.get_status())

response = rt.ask("What is TS-OS in one sentence?")
print(response.answer)
print(f"Confidence: {response.confidence}")
print(f"Hypotheses: {response.hypotheses}")

rt.shutdown()
```

### 5. Launch the Dashboard

```bash
dashboard-start
```

Open `http://localhost:8000/wave` for the live tension chart, or `http://localhost:8000/graph/viz` for the interactive graph.

## Complete Configuration Reference

All behavior is driven by **`config.yaml`** in the working directory, deep-merged over `RuntimeConfig` defaults by `core/config_loader.py`. The `core/config_schema.py` validator checks required sections and numeric ranges on startup. Set **`BOGGERS_CONFIG_STRICT=1`** (or pass `strict=True` to `validate_config`) to **raise** on validation warnings instead of only logging them.

## Python API

### Main Class: `BoggersRuntime`

```python
from BoggersTheAI import BoggersRuntime, RuntimeConfig
```

`BoggersRuntime` is the composition root. Its constructor loads `config.yaml`, creates the graph, starts the wave thread, wires all adapters/tools/engines, starts the OS loop, and registers health checks.

### Methods

#### `ask(query: str) -> QueryResponse`

Full query pipeline. Extracts topics, retrieves context from the graph, scores sufficiency, ingests from adapters if needed, routes to tools, synthesizes via LLM (or extractive fallback), checks hypothesis consistency, logs traces, consolidates into graph, and optionally writes vault insights. Uses multi-turn session context when `os_loop.multi_turn_enabled` is `true`.

#### `ask_audio(audio: bytes) -> QueryResponse`

Transcribes audio via the configured voice-in backend (faster-whisper), then passes the transcript to `ask()`.

#### `ask_image(image: bytes, query_hint: str = "") -> QueryResponse`

Captions the image via the configured image-in backend (BLIP2), optionally appends a query hint, then passes to `ask()`.

#### `speak(text: str) -> bytes`

Converts text to speech via the configured voice-out backend (piper). Returns raw audio bytes.

#### `get_status() -> dict`

Returns wave/graph observability data: cycle count, node count, edge count, current tension, wave thread alive status, last cycle timestamp.

#### `get_conversation_history(last_n: int = 8) -> list[dict]`

Returns the last N conversation turns from the current session, pulled from session nodes in the graph.

#### `build_training_dataset() -> dict`

Scans `traces/*.jsonl`, filters by `dataset_build.min_confidence`, converts to Alpaca format (`instruction`/`input`/`output`), splits 80/20 into `dataset/train.jsonl` and `dataset/val.jsonl`. Returns stats: total traces scanned, samples written, split counts.

#### `fine_tune_and_hotswap(epochs: int = 1) -> dict`

Runs QLoRA fine-tuning on the training dataset using the configured base model. If `validation_enabled`, evaluates on `val.jsonl` and gates the hot-swap. If `auto_hotswap` and validation passes, loads the new adapter into the running LocalLLM. Backs up the previous adapter to `backup_dir`. Returns training stats and swap status.

#### `trigger_self_improvement() -> dict`

Scheduled-style self-improvement: checks if enough new traces have accumulated (`min_new_traces`), builds dataset, optionally trains, validates, and hot-swaps. Designed to be called from the OS loop or the `improve` CLI command.

#### `run_health_checks() -> dict`

Runs all registered health checks (graph, wave, LLM) and returns overall status (`healthy` / `degraded`) with per-check results and duration in milliseconds.

#### `run_tui()`

Launches the Rich TUI if `tui.enabled` is `true`. Displays live graph stats and wave events.

#### `run_nightly_consolidation()`

Performs deep pruning, merging of similar nodes, and emergence spawning. Automatically called at the configured `nightly_hour_utc` and during `shutdown()`.

#### `shutdown()`

Stops the OS loop and TUI thread, optionally runs **`run_nightly_consolidation(force=True)`** when `os_loop.consolidation_on_shutdown` is `true`, saves the graph, stops the wave thread. Registered via `atexit`. If the mode manager cannot grant user mode in time, `ask()` may return a **busy** response (see router).

### Response Object: `QueryResponse`

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `answer` | str | The synthesized answer text |
| `topics` | list[str] | Topics extracted from the query |
| `sufficiency_score` | float | How sufficient the graph context was (0.0–1.0) |
| `used_research` | bool | Whether external adapters were called |
| `used_tool` | bool | Whether a tool was invoked |
| `hypotheses` | list[str] | Generated hypotheses about the answer |
| `confidence` | float | Confidence score (0.0–1.0) |
| `reasoning_trace` | str | Step-by-step reasoning trace from the LLM |
| `context_nodes` | list[str] | IDs of nodes used as context |
| `activation_scores` | dict[str, float] | Activation scores of context nodes |

---

## HTTP API & Dashboard

### Library Helper

`BoggersTheAI.interface.api.handle_query` is a thread-safe library function (not a standalone server):

```python
from BoggersTheAI.interface.api import handle_query

result = handle_query({"query": "Explain wave propagation"})
# result: {"ok": True, "answer": "...", "hypotheses": [...], "confidence": 0.85, ...}
```

Uses a singleton `BoggersRuntime` internally.

### Dashboard (FastAPI)

Start with:

```bash
dashboard-start
```

Override host/port with `BOGGERS_DASHBOARD_HOST` and `BOGGERS_DASHBOARD_PORT` environment variables.

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Content-Type | Description |
|----------|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `/status` | GET | Bearer (if token set) | `application/json` | Wave status, node/edge counts, tension, cycle count |
| `/wave` | GET | Public | `text/html` | Chart.js page with live tension chart (polls `/status` every few seconds) |
| `/graph` | GET | Bearer (if token set) | `application/json` | Full node and edge data as JSON |
| `/graph/viz` | GET | Public | `text/html` | Cytoscape.js interactive graph visualization — **polls `/graph` every ~2.5s** for live updates |
| `/metrics` | GET | Bearer (if token set) | `application/json` | Graph metrics (density, mean activation, stability distribution) + system metrics (counters, gauges) |
| `/traces` | GET | Bearer (if token set) | `application/json` | Recent trace files from the traces directory |
| `/health/live` | GET | Public | `application/json` | Liveness probe: `{"status": "alive"}` — no auth |
| `/health/ready` | GET | Bearer (if token set) | `application/json` | Readiness: runs `run_health_checks()` on the lazy runtime |

**Authentication:** When `BOGGERS_DASHBOARD_TOKEN` is set, protected endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. The bundled HTML pages (`/wave`, `/graph/viz`) include auth headers in fetch calls when a token cookie is present. For local development, leave the token unset.

**Lazy runtime:** The dashboard module does **not** construct `BoggersRuntime` at import time; it calls **`get_runtime()`** on first request (thread-safe singleton).

### Meta-critique traces & Grok loop

- **`traces/` is gitignored** (dynamic JSONL). The repo includes **`traces/meta_critique/.gitkeep`** so the path exists; your local `waves.jsonl` and `NEXT_GROK_PROMPT.txt` are still ignored.
- **Fold waves into the living graph:** set `runtime.fold_waves_jsonl_on_startup: true` in `config.yaml` to ingest `traces/meta_critique/waves.jsonl` as `meta:*` nodes on startup (inspectable in the dashboard Cytoscape view and `/metrics`).
- **One-shot loop continuation:** copy the **`embedded_full_cursor_prompt`** field from any row in local `waves.jsonl` and paste into Grok for instant TS-wave continuation (same content as `NEXT_GROK_PROMPT.txt` after each wave).
- **TUI:** when `tui.enabled` is true, the Rich Live dashboard refreshes at **~8 Hz** with live `folded_wave` counts (see `mind/tui.py`).

## Wave Cycle — What Happens Each Tick

Every `wave.interval_seconds` (default 30s), the background wave thread runs a full cycle through `core/graph/rules_engine.py`:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. ELECT STRONGEST                                      │
│    Find the node with highest activation (cached,       │
│    invalidated on mutation). This is the "wave source." │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 2. PROPAGATE                                            │
│    From the elected node, spread activation to          │
│    neighbors via two channels:                          │
│    • Topological: activation × edge_weight × spread     │
│    • Semantic: activation × cosine_sim × semantic_weight│
│    Combined and added to neighbor activations.          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 3. RELAX                                                │
│    All nodes: activation moves toward base_strength     │
│    by multiplying by relax_decay. Prevents runaway.     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 4. NORMALISE                                            │
│    Apply damping factor (default 0.95) to all           │
│    activations. Clamp to [0.0, activation_cap].         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 5. PRUNE EDGES                                          │
│    Remove edges with weight < prune_threshold (0.25).   │
│    Keeps the graph from accumulating noise.             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 6. MERGE SIMILAR TOPICS                                 │
│    Find node pairs sharing >50% topics with high        │
│    cosine similarity. Merge into single node,           │
│    combining content and taking max stability.          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 7. SPLIT OVERACTIVATED                                  │
│    Nodes with activation > 2× activation_cap are        │
│    split into two nodes with divided activation.        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 8. DETECT CONTRADICTIONS                                │
│    Group active nodes by topic. Compare pairs for       │
│    antonym conflicts. Calculate severity. Log.          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 9. RESOLVE CONTRADICTIONS                               │
│    For each detected contradiction: weaken or collapse  │
│    the node with lower stability. The more grounded     │
│    belief survives.                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 10. DETECT TENSION                                      │
│     Calculate tension score per node (constraint        │
│     violations). If max tension > tension_threshold:    │
│     → BREAK: collapse weakest node (lowest stability)   │
│     → EVOLVE: spawn up to EMERGENCE_MAX_SPAWN (2) new  │
│       nodes via LLM synthesis of high-tension content   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 11. INCREMENTAL SAVE                                    │
│     Every incremental_save_interval (5) cycles, persist │
│     only dirty (mutated) nodes to SQLite/JSON.          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Thread Model

BoggersTheAI runs multiple concurrent threads, carefully coordinated:

```
Main Thread
├── BoggersRuntime construction
├── CLI input loop (interface/chat.py) or user code
└── rt.ask() calls → QueryProcessor (acquires user mode lock)

Wave Thread (daemon)
├── Runs every wave.interval_seconds
├── Executes full rules_engine cycle
├── Acquires graph RLock for mutations
└── Pauses on: high tension, guardrail limits, user mode active

OS Loop Thread (daemon)
├── Runs every os_loop.interval_seconds
├── Checks idle_threshold_seconds since last query
├── If idle: runs exploration / consolidation / insight
├── Coordinates with ModeManager (AUTO mode)
└── Processes hypothesis queue

Dashboard Thread (if started)
├── FastAPI/uvicorn serving HTTP
└── Reads graph state (acquires RLock for reads)
```

### Synchronization Primitives

| Lock | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `RLock` | `UniversalLivingGraph` | Thread-safe node/edge mutations and reads |
| `threading.Condition` | `ModeManager` | AUTO/USER mode coordination with timeout |
| `threading.Lock` | `QueryRouter._queue_lock` | Hypothesis queue access |
| `threading.Lock` | `BoggersRuntime._state_lock` | Query timing state |
| `threading.Lock` | `BoggersRuntime._llm_lock` | LLM adapter hot-swap |
| `threading.Lock` | `MetricsCollector` | Counter/gauge/timer updates |

### Preventing Races

The `ModeManager` prevents the wave thread and OS loop from mutating the graph during a user query:

1. User query arrives → `request_user_mode(timeout=10)` blocks until AUTO cycle finishes
2. Query runs with exclusive user-mode access
3. Query completes → `release_to_auto()` allows background cycles to resume

                         running LocalLLM        from backup_dir
```

### Steps in Detail

1. **Trace Logging:** Every `ask()` call that produces a response with `confidence ≥ min_confidence_for_log` (default 0.7) writes a JSONL record to `traces/`.

2. **Dataset Build** (`build_training_dataset()`): `TraceProcessor` scans all trace files, filters by `dataset_build.min_confidence` (0.75), converts each to Alpaca format (`{"instruction": ..., "input": ..., "output": ...}`), shuffles, splits at `split_ratio` (0.8), and writes `dataset/train.jsonl` and `dataset/val.jsonl`.

3. **Fine-Tuning** (`fine_tune_and_hotswap()`): `UnslothFineTuner` loads the base model with 4-bit quantization, applies LoRA adapters, trains on `train.jsonl` for the configured epochs, and saves the adapter.

4. **Validation:** If `validation_enabled`, evaluates on `val.jsonl`. If loss exceeds threshold, the hot-swap is blocked.

5. **Hot-Swap:** If `auto_hotswap` and validation passes, the new adapter is loaded into the running `LocalLLM` instance. The previous adapter is backed up to `backup_dir`.

6. **Rollback:** If the new adapter degrades performance (detected at next validation), `LocalLLM` rolls back to the backup.

7. **Safety Dry Run:** When `safety_dry_run` is `true`, the full pipeline runs but the adapter is not actually loaded — useful for testing.

### Supported Base Models

- `unsloth/llama-3.2-1b-instruct`
- `unsloth/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct`
- `unsloth/gemma-2-2b-it`

---

## Multimodal Capabilities

### Voice Input (`ask_audio`)

- **Backend:** faster-whisper (CTranslate2-based Whisper)
- **Process:** Audio bytes → temp WAV file → transcription → `ask()` → cleanup temp file
- **Fallback:** If faster-whisper is not installed, returns a placeholder message

### Voice Output (`speak`)

- **Backend:** piper-tts
- **Process:** Text → piper synthesis → raw audio bytes
- **Fallback:** If piper is not installed, returns empty bytes

### Image Input (`ask_image`)

- **Backend:** BLIP2 (via HuggingFace transformers)
- **Process:** Image bytes → BLIP2 captioning → optional query hint appended → `ask()`
- **Fallback:** If transformers is not installed, returns a placeholder caption

All multimodal adapters implement protocols defined in `core/protocols.py` (`VoiceInProtocol`, `VoiceOutProtocol`, `ImageInProtocol`) for clean dependency inversion.

## Security Model

### Code Execution Sandbox (`tools/code_run.py`)

- **Timeout:** Configurable via `tools.code_run_timeout_seconds` (default 5 seconds)
- **Import restrictions:** Both line-scan AND AST-based detection of:
  - Direct `import` of dangerous modules (`os`, `sys`, `subprocess`, `shutil`, etc.)
  - `__import__()` calls (including obfuscated forms)
  - `exec()` and `eval()` calls
- **Restricted builtins:** Only safe builtins are available in the execution namespace
- **Process isolation:** Code runs in a subprocess with resource limits

### File Read Restrictions (`tools/file_read.py`)

- **Base directory restriction:** Base path is **pinned at tool construction** (resolved `Path`), not the current working directory at call time
- **Max size:** Reads reject files larger than a configurable **max bytes** (default 1 MiB)
- **Extension allowlist:** Only permitted file extensions can be read (includes `.toml`, `.cfg`, `.ini`, plus code and data extensions)
- **Path traversal prevention:** Paths must resolve under the base directory; `core/path_sandbox.validate_path` is used where applicable

### Network Security

- **RSS adapter:** HTTPS-only enforcement — HTTP feed URLs are rejected
- **X API adapter:** Requires `X_BEARER_TOKEN` environment variable (never stored in config)
- **Dashboard auth:** Token-based Bearer authentication via `BOGGERS_DASHBOARD_TOKEN`

### Data Privacy

- **Local-first:** No data leaves your machine unless you explicitly enable cloud adapters
- **No telemetry:** Zero phone-home behavior
- **`.gitignore`:** Graph databases, traces, datasets, models, and vault are excluded from version control by default

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Quick run
pytest -q

# Verbose with coverage
pytest --cov=BoggersTheAI -v

# With coverage enforcement (CI uses --cov-fail-under=60)
pytest --cov=BoggersTheAI --cov-fail-under=60
```

### Test Stats

- **200+ tests** across many modules (graph, wave, http client, rules engine, sqlite, config loader, plugins, tools, adapters, dashboard, concurrency, etc.)
- **~70%** line coverage typical locally; CI fails if total coverage drops below **60%**
- Tests cover: graph operations, wave runner, synthesis, routing, runtime lifecycle, tool execution (including web search / datetime / unit convert), adapter behavior (mocked HTTP via `http_client`), multimodal fallbacks, concurrency, dashboard endpoints, config validation, protocols, events, metrics, health checks

### CI Pipeline

GitHub Actions runs on every push and PR:

- **Matrix:** Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- **Caching:** pip dependencies cached via `actions/cache`
- **Linting:** `ruff check`, `black --check`, `isort --check`
- **Type checking:** `mypy` (blocking — must pass)
- **Tests:** `pytest --cov=BoggersTheAI --cov-fail-under=60`
